# Freelist Collection for Rust

[![Build Status](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/freelist/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/freelist/actions?workflow=Build) 

A cache coherent freelist collection written in Rust.

This repo is starting as a project for me to learn Rust.  I have written one of these in C++ by manipulating and casting the memory manually, so it will be interesting to see how it compares to the Rust implementation.
