# Freelist Collection for Rust

A cache coherent freelist collection written in Rust.

This repo is starting as a project for me to learn Rust.  If it ends up being faster than [this allocator](https://docs.rs/allocators/0.1.9/allocators/freelist/struct.FreeList.html) it can be quite useful.

I have written one of these in C++ by manipulating and casting the memory manually, so it will be interesting to see how it compares to the Rust implementation.
